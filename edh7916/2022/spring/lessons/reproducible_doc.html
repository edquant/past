<p>In this lesson, we’ll combine many of the pieces we’ve already
covered — reading in data, cleaning data, making figures
— into a single RMarkdown document. We’ll purposefully keep it
simple at first by reusing some code we’ve seen before.</p>

<h1 id="getting-started">Getting started</h1>

<p>To properly compile a PDF documents from Markdown, you’ll need some
version of <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/">LaTeX</a>, a typesetting
system best known for being able to nicely render mathematical
notation but that is really useful for making reproducible
documents. You should have already downloaded this at the start of the
course. If you didn’t, visit the <a href="../software/index.html">software
page</a> for information on how to get it.</p>

<p>If you are unable to get LaTeX to install properly or cannot get the
document to compile as PDF, you should be able to compile to HTML
instead.</p>

<p>You will also need the R <strong>knitr</strong> and <strong>rmarkdown</strong> libraries. You should
have <strong>rmarkdown</strong> already, but if you haven’t already installed either, type</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">install.packages</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"knitr"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"rmarkdown"</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>into your R console. <strong>NOTE</strong> that even if you’ve already installed
rmarkdown, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">install.packages()</code> will just quickly reinstall it.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-rmarkdown">What is RMarkdown?</h1>

<p><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html">From the RStudio
website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. An
R Markdown document is written in markdown (an easy-to-write plain
text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, an RMarkdown (hereafter <em>RMD</em>) document has two basic
components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>R code (in <strong>code chunks</strong>)</li>
  <li>Markdown text (most everything else outside of the code chunks)</li>
</ul>

<p>RMD documents use the file ending, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.Rmd</code>, which makes sense as they
combine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code> code with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">md</code> text. To <em>compile</em> an RMD file, meaning to</p>

<ol>
  <li>convert the plain Markdown text into formatted text</li>
  <li>run R code, producing all output along the way</li>
  <li>combine the Markdown text plus R output into a finished document</li>
</ol>

<p>You will use the <strong>rmarkdown</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">render()</code> function, which in turn uses
the <strong>knitr</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">knit()</code> function under the hood. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40563480">It can be a bit
confusing how all the pieces work
together</a>, but luckily, you can
use RStudio’s point-and-click interface to knit your documents.</p>

<h1 id="starting-a-new-document">Starting a new document</h1>

<p>When you open a blank RMarkdown document, RStudio will by default fill
it with some example text that looks like this. You can change this in
RStudio’s settings, but I think it’s helpful to see the skeleton of an
RMarkdown document (plus, it’s not a big deal to just erase the parts
you don’t need).</p>

<h3 id="example-text-in-new-file-started-via-rstudio-default">Example text in new file started via RStudio (default)</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
title: "Document Title"
author: "Benjamin Skinner"
date: "1/30/21"
output: pdf_document
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see &lt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&gt;.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Rather than going through this example text to learn about RMarkdown,
we’ll use our own example document, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_scores.Rmd</code>, which is linked
above.</p>

<h1 id="compile-an-rmarkdown-document">Compile an RMarkdown document</h1>

<p>We’ll go through the main sections our example RMD document below. So
you can follow along better, you should compile <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_scores.Rmd</code> as
your first step.</p>

<p>Once you’ve downloaded the file and data (if you don’t have it
already), place the RMD file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scripts</code> directory and the
unzipped data in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> directory.</p>

<p>When you open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test_scores.Rmd</code> in RStudio, you should see a button in
the upper left facet that says <strong>Knit</strong> with a ball of string icon.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/rstudio_rmarkdown.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you have the working directory correctly set to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scripts</code> and have placed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sch_test/</code> data folder inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code>,
you should be able to click <strong>Knit</strong> and have the document
compile into a PDF. By default, RStudio will open a PDF viewer window
or show you the file in the lower right facet in the <strong>Viewer</strong> tab.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> that if you’ve had trouble with LaTeX, you should be
able to compile into an HTML file, which you can open in your browser.</p>

<h1 id="sections-of-our-document">Sections of our document</h1>

<h2 id="yaml-header">YAML header</h2>

<p>YAML, which stands for <a href="https://yaml.org">“YAML Ain’t a Markup
Language”</a>, is a common way to configure dynamic documents
like RMD documents. It’s the first thing you see at the top of an
RMarkdown file. The YAML header is this piece of code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
title: "Test scores from 1980-1985"
author: Benjamin Skinner
date: \today
output: pdf_document
---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the opening and closing three hyphens (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">---</code>). This is how R
knows that this section of code is special. The YAML can become
complex, as you add document options, but for now we keep it simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>title</strong>: the document title (printed)</li>
  <li><strong>author</strong>: the document author (printed)</li>
  <li><strong>date</strong>: manually set date (printed)
    <ul>
      <li>leave <strong>date</strong> out of YAML and the date on which the document is
compiled will be added automatically, or you can use the LaTeX
macro <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\today</code>, which will also print today’s date</li>
      <li>set <strong>date</strong> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">""</code> (empty string) for no printed date</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>output</strong>: document output
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf_output</code>: for PDF (uses LaTeX)</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html_output</code>: for web page output (open in browser)</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">word_output</code>: for MSWord output (uses MSWord)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We’re using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdf_output</code> but you can either change this setting or
override it when compiling the final document.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> that the colon (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code>) is a special character in YAML. Notice that I
don’t necessarily have to use quotation marks for strings with spaces —
I do for the title, but not for my name. That said, if your title
includes a colon, you need to wrap the entire title string in double
quotation marks (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code>) — otherwise the document won’t compile.</p>

<h2 id="code-chunks">Code chunks</h2>

<p>In general, an RMD code chunk looks like a markdown code chunk. The
key difference between the two is that while a plain markdown code
chunk is purely about formatting, the RMD code chunk will by default
try to run the code and print any output:</p>

<h4 id="markdown-code-chunk">Markdown code chunk</h4>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">r
</span><span class="c1">## this is just a representation </span><span class="w">
</span><span class="c1">## when compiled: nothing happens, only code is printed</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">rnorm</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">1000</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">x</span>
<span class="p">```</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="rmarkdown-code-chunk">RMarkdown code chunk</h4>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">{r}
</span><span class="sb">## this is active R code
## when compiled: the R code is run, and both code and results are printed
x &lt;- rnorm(1000)
x</span>
<span class="p">```</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>See the difference? It’s subtle, but notice that the RMD chunk
places braces around the <strong>r</strong> after the tick marks: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{r}</code>. In a
normal markdown document, the braces won’t mean anything. But in an
RMD document, it’s the difference between just printing the code and
running the code before printing the code and its output.</p>

<h3 id="code-chunk-options">Code chunk options</h3>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```{r setup, echo=F, include=F, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
## ---------------------------
## libraries
## ---------------------------

library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

## ---------------------------
## settings/macros
## ---------------------------

## NB:
## - echo (FALSE): don't repeat this code in output
## - include (FALSE): run code, but don't include output (unless a plot)
## - message (FALSE): don't output any messages
## - warning (FALSE): don't output any warnings
## - error (FALSE: don't output any errors
##
## We'll include these in the general knitr::opts_chunk() below, but
## need them here to silence unnecessary output before we can set the options

## set up knitr options
opts_chunk$set(error = FALSE,
               echo = FALSE,
               include = FALSE,
               message = FALSE,
               warning = FALSE,
               fig.path = "../figures/ts-", # where figures should be stored
               dpi = 300,                   # print quality (300 standard for print)
               out.width = "100%",          # figures should be as wide as margins
               comment = NA)                # if code output, no comment char on LHS

## ---------------------------
## directory paths
## ---------------------------

## read in our data here, assuming we're in scripts like always
dat_dir &lt;- file.path("..", "data", "sch_test")
```
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In our first code chunk, notice how we still load our libraries and
set our file paths. For the libraries, we need to load knitr with
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">library(knitr)</code> in addition to whichever libraries we need for our
analysis. As usual, we also load the tidyverse.</p>

<p>In addition to our normal analysis setup, notice that we add
knitr-specific options in two places.</p>

<h4 id="local-code-chunk-options-only-affect-this-code-chunk">Local code chunk options (only affect <em>this</em> code chunk)</h4>

<p>First, we can set <em>local code chunk options</em> within the braces that
start the code chunk. These options will only affect this particular
code chunk.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```{r setup, echo=F, include=F, message=F, warning=F, error=F}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r</code>, the first word is the name of the chunk. I’ve called it
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup</code>, since that’s what this chunk is doing, but you can name it
anything you want. It’s not strictly necessary to name your chunks,
but it can come in handy as your documents become more complex: if you
get an error, it’s much easier to find <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data_input</code> chunk than
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unnamed_chunk_38</code>. <strong>NOTE</strong> that all named chunks need to be unique
or your document will not compile. If really like a particular chunk
and want to reuse it, you can always add a number at the end:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data_input_1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data_input_2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data_input_3</code>, <em>etc</em>.</p>

<p>There are a lot of <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/options/">options you can
set</a> for your chunks. Here we set
the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo=F</code> (FALSE): don’t repeat this code in output</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include=F</code> (FALSE): run code, but don’t include output (unless a
plot)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">message=F</code> (FALSE): don’t output any messages</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">warning=F</code> (FALSE): don’t output any warnings</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">error=F</code> (FALSE): don’t output any errors</li>
</ul>

<p>As of <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr/releases/tag/v1.35">knitr 1.35</a>,
you can also include chunk options in rows below the opening line
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#|</code> symbol pair. We could rewrite our example options
using:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">{r setup}
</span><span class="sb">#| echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, message = FALSE
#| warning = FALSE, error = FALSE

&lt; ...chunk code... &gt;</span>
<span class="p">```</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could also use yaml syntax, which is nice for very long lines 
(we don’t need that now, but it does come up sometimes).</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">```</span><span class="nl">{r setup}
</span><span class="sb">#| echo: FALSE 
#| include: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE
#| error: FALSE

&lt; ...chunk code... &gt;   </span>
<span class="p">```</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However you choose to include them, these options keep our chunk from
echoing the input code into our document and prevents any
output. Basically, silence. Sometimes we want our code to echo;
sometimes we want output. But since we are making a report, we
generally want the underlying code to remain hidden. Readers of our
report should only see the write up and any relevant tables and
figures — but not all the hard coding we did to make them!</p>

<h4 id="global-code-chunk-options-affect-all-code-chunks">Global code chunk options (affect <em>all</em> code chunks)</h4>

<p>After this first chunk, we can save some typing by setting these
options for the rest of the document using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">knitr::opt_chunks$set()</code>. Notice that we include the same settings as
above plus a few more:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig.path</code>: path + prefix for all figures (put them in our
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/figures</code> folder and add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"ts-"</code> to the name)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dpi</code> (dots per inch): the print quality of our figures; 300 dpi is
a nice standard for print (72dpi is sufficient for most web output)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out.width</code>: our figures should fill the line width; if it’s an 8.5
by 11 inch page with 1 inch margins, then a width of 7.5 inches</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comment</code>: if we return code output, don’t prepend with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> or
anything — just the output.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/options/">There are other options we can
use</a>. We can also override these
setting as necessary for individual code chunks using local settings
like we did in the first chunk (as you’ll see below). The main idea
with the set up code chunk is to get our document settings as close as
possible to the way we generally want them.</p>

<h3 id="chunk-to-chunk">Chunk to chunk</h3>

<p>Below, you see two code chunks with some Markdown text in the middle.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```{r input}
## ---------------------------
## input
## ---------------------------

## read in data
df &lt;- read_csv(file.path(dat_dir, "all_schools.csv"))
```

From 1980 to 1985, students at four schools took end of year exams in
three subjects --- math, reading, and science. While these tests did
not affect students' grades or promotion, they were meant to measure
what students had learned over the course of the school year. In each
year, only 9th grade students took the exam. This means that each year
of data represents a different cohort of 9th grade students. Because
test scores are standardized within subject area, student cohorts can
be compared across time. The table below shows average test scores for
each school in each year.

```{r table_all, include = T}
## ---------------------------
## make table of all scores
## ---------------------------

## use the kable() function in knitr to make nicer table
kable(df,
      digits = 0,
      col.names = c("", "Year", "Math", "Reading", "Science"))
```
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An important thing to remember is that your coding environment carries
from chunk to chunk, meaning that if you read in data in the code
chunk (named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input</code>) as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df</code> will still be available to
you in the next chunk (named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table_all</code>) after writing some Markdown
text. This means that you can still organize your RMD scripts like
your R scripts (no need to do everything at once in a single huge
chunk).</p>

<h3 id="make-a-nicer-table-with-kable">Make a nice(r) table with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kable()</code></h3>

<p>Since we want to show all of our data (which isn’t very big in this case) and
because the data frame <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df</code> already is organized in the way we want to
show the data (school by year with different columns for each test),
we can just print out the data frame. To be clear, often our data will
be too big to do this, but in this instance, we are okay.</p>

<p>We could just print the data frame by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df</code> in a chunk. But to
make it look nicer with a better format, we use <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kable()</code> which is part of
knitr</a>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```{r table_all, include = T}
## ---------------------------
## make table of all scores
## ---------------------------

## use the kable() function in knitr to make nicer table
kable(df,
      digits = 0,
      col.names = c("", "Year", "Math", "Reading", "Science"))
```
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Even using mostly default options, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kable()</code> will make a nice looking
table for us. We add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">digits = 0</code> to make sure that we only show whole
numbers and we change our column names to something nicer (leaving a
blank <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">""</code> for the school name column, which is obvious). Notice that
in the chunk braces we add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include = T</code> so that the output — our
table — for just this one code chunk will be printed. This is an
example of using local code chunk options to override global chunk
options.</p>

<h3 id="inline-code">Inline code</h3>

<p>You can also call R code <em>inline</em>, that is, R code that sits outside of code chunks
proper and instead is mixed in with your Markdown text.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```{r table_averages, include = T}
## ---------------------------
## make table of averages

    ## get average across years

hi_sci_scr &lt;- df_tab %&gt;% filter(science_mean == max(science_mean)) %&gt;% pull(science_mean)

## use the kable() function in knitr to make nicer table
kable(df_tab,
      digits = 0,
      col.names = c("", "Math", "Reading", "Science"))
```

Across the six years of data, `r hi_math_sch` had the
highest average math score (`r hi_math_scr %&gt;% round`); 
`r hi_read_sch` had the highest average reading score 
(`r hi_read_scr %&gt;% round`); and 
`r hi_sci_sch` had the highest average science score 
(`r hi_sci_scr %&gt;% round`). However, these six year averages cover a fair
amount of variation within schools across time. In the next sections, I'll
investigate this variation.

<p>Inside the code chunk called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">table_averages</code> we do three things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use <strong>dplyr</strong> to munge our data to get averages</li>
  <li>Store names and scores for high test scores in distinct well named
objects:
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hi_&lt;test&gt;_sch</code>: school name with highest average math/read/science
score</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hi_&lt;test&gt;_scr</code>: highest average math/read/science score</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make/print table using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kable()</code></li>
</ol>

<p>In the Markdown text below this code chunk, we call the values using
the inline code method</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="sb">`r `</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>that is, single back tick, an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">r</code>, the code we want, then closing back
tick. We also pipe the object value to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">round()</code> function so that
we don’t return averages with extra and unnecessary decimal points. We
could have simply run all the code inline (included what we did in
step 2 of the code chunk above), but that would have made for extra
messy code.</p>

<p>Why do this? One reason is that being able to incorporate data-driven
values directly in your test is very powerful. Imagine you need to
reproduce the same report on a monthly or quarterly basis when data
are updated. Part of the written report includes values directly taken
or calculated from the data. Rather than update these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)">“magic
numbers”</a>
each time (potentially missing some), you can use inline R code like
we’ve done here. All you need to do then is update the data and
recompile the report. Voila! Everything is properly updated.</p>

<p>Taking it a step further, you can include all kinds of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifelse()</code> logic to make
complex dynamic documents. <em>If</em> the value of <em>X</em> is equal to or greater than the
value of <em>Y</em>, then print “equals or exceeds”; <em>else</em> print “remains
less than”. Be aware, however, that your document text
still needs to make sense. It can be difficult enough writing one
clear sentence; having to write a sentence that will remain coherent
despite variable inputs can be <em>very tough</em>!</p>

<h3 id="figures">Figures</h3>

<p>Finally, making figures is pretty much the same as making tables:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>```{r fig_unadjusted, include = T}
## ---------------------------
## fig: unadjusted
## ---------------------------

## reshape data long for figure
df_long &lt;- df %&gt;%
    pivot_longer(cols = c("math","read","science"), # cols to pivot long
                 names_to = "test",                 # where col names go
                 values_to = "score")               # where col values go

## facet line graph, with one column so they stack
p &lt;- ggplot(data = df_long,
            mapping = aes(x = year, y = score, colour = school)) +
    facet_wrap(~ test, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y",
               ## assign test score names new values for facet titles
               ## e.g., when test == "math" make title "Math"
               labeller = labeller(test = c(math = "Math",
                                            read = "Reading",
                                            science = "Science"))) +
    geom_line() +
    ## add axis and legend labels
    labs(y = "Test score (normalized within test)",
         x = "Test year (spring)",
         ## assign legend title to match aes mapping: colour
         colour = "School") 

## call figure object, which will now print to document
p
```
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Having reshaped our original data frame long (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df_long</code>), we make a
figure just as we’ve done in the past — with some formatting
improvements to make it nicer looking. While it’s not strictly
necessary to store the figure in an object (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p</code>) that we then call, it
works just fine.</p>

<p>Notice that again added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include = T</code> to the chunk brace. Because we
added figure options to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">opt_chunks$set()</code> in the setup code chunk,
this figure (as well as the next one) is sized so that it fills up the
page width (with height determined as a ratio of that width) and
printed at 300 dpi quality. If you look in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">figures</code> folder,
you’ll see the figure named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ts-fig_unadjusted</code>, which is the prefix
we set above with the name of the code chunk.</p>

<h2 id="text">Text</h2>

<p>Throughout our RMD file, we’ve include Markdown text. This text lives
outside of the code chunks and is always printed in the final
document. It follows normal Markdown text rules, but can have R code
placed inline, as we saw above.</p>

<h1 id="writing-an-rmd-document">Writing an RMD document</h1>

<p>Just as when you write a plain R script, your progress from initial
RMD draft to final product will be iterative. While you can run R code
from inside code chunks just as you’ve been all semester, you may find
it useful to start your analyses in plain R files first and only add
them to an RMD document later.</p>

<p>For big projects, such as dissertation, it also doesn’t make much
sense to put <em>everything</em> — data reading, cleaning, analysis,
table/figure making — inside a single RMD document. You have to redo
your entire workflow each time you compile! For large projects, it
might make sense to do all the heavy lifting in separate R scripts —
saving cleaned up data sets, tables, and figures along the way — and
putting all the pre-establish pieces together at the end. But for
small projects, such a descriptive policy report, a single RMD
document might suffice.</p>
