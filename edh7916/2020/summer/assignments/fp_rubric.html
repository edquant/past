<p>There are five major areas to the final project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data Analysis</li>
  <li>Graphical/Tabular Presentation</li>
  <li>Written Description</li>
  <li>Organization, Clarity, and Formatting</li>
  <li>Coding</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>A strong final project</strong> will have a data analysis that cleanly
wrangles raw data into an analysis-ready data set; correctly
performs all descriptive and statistical analyses necessary to
answer the research question; and well presents the results. The
analyses do not necessarily have to be complex, but they should
represent the best reasonable approach.</li>
  <li><strong>An acceptable final project</strong> will have a data analysis that
includes some some mistakes or inaccuracies in how the data are
cleaned, analyses are run, and/or results are presented. The
analyses may not be quite appropriate for the analytic task.</li>
  <li><strong>A weak final project</strong> data analysis will not correctly wrangle
raw data into a clean data set, will not well describe
relationships between predictors and the outcome, will not use
appropriate analytic tools, and will not present results well or at
all. In general, the analysis will be messy and unable to provide
insights into the research questions/problems motivated in the report.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="graphicaltabular-presentation">Graphical/Tabular Presentation</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>A strong final project</strong> will include nicely labeled, easy to
understand graphics that describe exactly what is happening with
the patterns in the data. The graphics may be simple or complex,
but they clearly connect to the analysis (<em>e.g.</em> not just a figure
for the sake of a figure). The response could include (but doesn’t
have to include) interactive graphics. A table or two may be
included, but only sparingly and in a clear format.</li>
  <li><strong>An acceptable final project</strong> will include graphics, but these
figures may not be easy to read, may not be sufficiently detailed,
or may not represent the most appropriate way to show the
relationships in the data. A table or two may be included, but not
appropriately formatted or without a clear rationale for its
inclusion (<em>i.e.</em> why a table and not a figure).</li>
  <li><strong>A weak final project</strong> will include graphics and/or tables that
are poorly labeled and don’t make much sense.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="written-description">Written Description</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>A strong final project</strong> will include clear and concise written
sections that are easily understandable by an interested
layperson. Assume that your audience is your boss or a
colleague—not me.</li>
  <li><strong>An acceptable final project</strong> will be written generally well, but
technical details may be poorly described or not described at all,
and sentences will be hard to follow.</li>
  <li><strong>A weak final project</strong> will be poorly written, with many mistakes
regarding both the analysis and good writing practices.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="organization-clarity-formatting">Organization, Clarity, Formatting</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>A strong final project</strong> will have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.Rmd</code> file that generates a very
nicely formatted document, suitable for professional
presentation. What kind of report would you want to give to a
supervisor or have given to you? That’s what I want back from
you. The organization should be very clear and easy to understand.</li>
  <li><strong>An acceptable final project</strong> will have some formatting problems and may
not look very nice.</li>
  <li><strong>A weak final project</strong> will include code chunks in the output, poor
formatting, and in general will just be messy.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="coding">Coding</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>A strong final project</strong> will have code that can generate results from
the raw data in an easy to understand way. The code will be
commented and will run on my computer without my having to tweak it
in any way. (<strong>NOTE:</strong> An easy test on your end is transfer your
files to a new location with the appropriate directory structure
and attempt to knit the document)</li>
  <li><strong>An acceptable final project</strong> will have code that is relatively clear,
but that may not be commented in ways that make sense and that has
some problems that require debugging on my end.</li>
  <li><strong>A weak final project</strong> will have code that is messy, hard to understand
and not commented. It will not run on my computer, and cannot be
easily debugged.</li>
</ol>
