<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong> This assignment needs to be completed by the start of the next
class. That means everything pushed to your remote GitHub repo before
class starts. If you are unsure whether you have successfully pushed
your changes, check the online version of your repo at GitHub.com. If
you can see your changes there, I can see them too.</em></p>

<p><em>Remember, I encourage you to save your work, commit smaller changes,
and push to your remote GitHub repo often rather than wait until the
last minute.</em></p>

<p>Now that you’ve selected a topic and data set for your final
reproducible report, it’s time to conduct a preliminary analysis. In
short, I want you to use the skills you’ve learned so far to answer the
questions you’ve set for yourself. Specifically, I want you to submit
<strong>two items</strong>. Both should be stored in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final_project</code> folder.</p>

<h3 id="1-markdown-file-on-how-to-get-data">(1) Markdown file on how to get data</h3>

<p>Submit a Markdown (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>) file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final_project_instructions.md</code>
that explains how to get the data required for your analysis and where
it needs to be placed in relation to your R script. The instructions
need to be detailed enough that I can find, download, unzip (if
necessary), and place the raw data files so that your script will run.
Assume I’m me, but am not familar with your data (<em>i.e.</em> that I’ll
figure it out).</p>

<p>This means that it’s not enough to say, “Get these files from IPEDS,”
and then list files. You should include a link to the proper webpage and
instructions for any clicking that I need to do to get your data.</p>

<h3 id="2-r-script">(2) R script</h3>

<p>Create an R script called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final_project_analysis.R</code> that does the
following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reads in your data — if your analysis requires combining multiple
data sets (<em>e.g.</em> IPEDS data files), then you need to read in and
append/join all files as required to construct your analysis data
set</li>
  <li>Selects the variables you need for your analysis (if your raw data
contains more columns than you need)</li>
  <li>Filters rows due to:
    <ul>
      <li>missing values</li>
      <li>values that are outside the scope of your analysis (<em>e.g.</em>, you
are using national data, but only need information about
Florida)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mutates (adds) new variables that you need for your analysis</li>
  <li>Saves your prepared analysis data frame to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> directory —
you can save it in whichever format makes sense to you: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.csv</code>,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rds</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rda</code>, <em>etc</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Your R script should also have a section that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generates basic descriptive/summary statistics that are relevant to
your analysis (<em>e.g.</em> if using IPEDS to show average graduation
rates among Florida public colleges and universities, show average
graduation rates for each year in your sample). For this part of the
assignment, you do not need to produce any formatted output (tables,
figures, text, <em>etc</em>): we’ll work on that after the break. Instead,
you can just have results printed to the console.</li>
  <li><strong>EXTRA</strong>: If you have familiarity with more advanced inferential
techniques such as regression and think you may use one in your
report, feel free to fit a model. That said, we have not covered
this yet and it is not required. But if you are able to do the other
steps and an want to move ahead, then go for it!</li>
</ol>

<p>Your R script should be well-organized, following our template. It
should be well commented throughout, explaining what you are doing,
particularly if making subjective data cleaning decisions or writing
your own functions. It should also run from top to bottom without error
or requiring that the user change anything.</p>

<p>I don’t expect that your full analysis will be completed in two weeks.
You may end up changing some analyses or adding new ones. But I do
expect you are able to put your data together and produce at least a
couple of statistics. I fully expect that you will repurpose this code
in your final report so the more you do now, the better off you’ll be.</p>
