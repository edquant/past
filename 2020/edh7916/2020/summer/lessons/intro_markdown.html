<p>In addition to using R in this course, you will also learn to use
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown, a plain text markup language created by John Gruber in
2004</a>. If you’re
thinking, no, not <em>another</em> language — rest assured that Markdown is
very easy to learn and use. In fact, it’s possible you’ve already used
Markdown (or a version of it) if you’ve ever used Slack or a
lightweight writing tool like iAWriter.</p>

<h3 id="but-why-not-just-use-ms-word"><em>But why not just use MS Word?</em></h3>

<p>Most people who do any writing on a computer are familiar with MS
Word. Even people who don’t use MS Word likely write with a MS
Word-like program. Since we’re all on the same page, why introduce a
new way to write — why Markdown?</p>

<p>The primary reason to bother is that Markdown files are easier to
share and better support replicability in a quantitative research
workflow. Understanding why this it the case requires first
understanding the difference in how each of these writing tools
handles a document’s content and formatting.</p>

<h2 id="wysiwyg-vs-wysiwym">WYSIWYG vs WYSIWYM</h2>

<h3 id="what-you-see-is-what-you-get">“What you see is what you <em>get</em>”</h3>

<p><em>WYSIWYG</em> (pronounced how you might guess - “whizzy-whig”) stands for
<em>what you see is what you get</em>. MS Word and similar programs are
WYSIWYG writing tools. Want some text bolded? You highlight the text,
click on the bold text button (or hit Control/Command-B) and the text
becomes <strong>bold</strong>. Want 1.05” margins to increase the page count
(teachers <em>always</em> know, by the way…), then you adjust the margins
and watch the text squeeze a little and the page count increase.</p>

<p>The point is that as you write, you control the <em>content</em> and how it’s
<em>formatted</em> at the same time. This is really powerful. You can see
your document (literally) taking shape and when you’re done writing,
you’re mostly done formatting, too.</p>

<p>But one problem from a research perspective is that WYSIWYG document
preparation programs don’t always share well, meaning that the
formatting isn’t always preserved across computers or operating
systems. Sometimes equations don’t open correctly; the font you
selected doesn’t exist on another computer. While programs may be able
to open each other’s files (<em>e.g.</em> OpenOffice can open a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code>
file), that’s not always the case. They open different-program files
with many errors or even not at all.</p>

<p>The second problem is they don’t work well with reproducible
workflows. Let’s say you’ve done some data analysis and make 10 tables
and 10 figures. You’ve carefully placed and formatted in your MS Word
report. Perfect! But before giving to your supervisor or submitting to
a journal, you get some new data and need to rerun everything…ah!
You’ll have to go through the whole transfer and formatting process
again, increasing the likelihood of introducing errors.</p>

<h3 id="what-you-see-is-what-you-mean">“What you see is what you <em>mean</em>”</h3>

<p><em>WYSIWIM</em> (“whizzy-whim”), on the other hand, separates formatting
from content. Rather than making bold text bold, you instead add a bit
of markup — some special syntax — to the text you want to be
bold. Only when the document is finally <em>compiled</em> into the final
form will the <strong>text be bold</strong>.</p>

<p>Markdown syntax uses plain text characters to indicate
formatting. This lesson was written in Markdown, so to show you an
example, here’s the prior paragraph, in plain Markdown syntax:</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="ge">_WYSIWIM_</span> ("whizzy-whim"), on the other hand, separates formatting
from content. Rather than making bold text bold, you instead add a bit
of markup --- some special syntax --- to the text you want to be
bold. Only when the document is finally _compiled_ into the final
form will the <span class="gs">**text be bold**</span>. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Markdown solves the two problems noted above. First, it’s written in
plain text, which means that it can be opened on any computer running
any operating system. Even if the end user doesn’t have a way to
compile the raw Markdown syntax into the nice-looking final form, the
text is still very legible. In fact, this feature — ability to read
uncompiled — was a motivating force behind the development of
Markdown:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable
as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with
tags or formatting instructions. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"><em>(John Gruber, Markdown
website)</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, because it’s plain text, it integrates well with scripting
languages like R. Remember our example from before? If your final
report was in Markdown instead of MS Word, you could rerun your
analyses with the updated data and then recompile your final report
— tables and figures updated automatically!</p>

<p>In fact, R and Markdown work so well together that you can combine
them in a single — appropriately named — RMarkdown document that
takes a combined file ending:</p>

<ol>
  <li>R script: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">analysis.R</code></li>
  <li>Markdown script: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_up.md</code></li>
  <li>RMarkdown script: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">report.Rmd</code></li>
</ol>

<p>or</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">analysis.R</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_up.md</code> = <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">report.Rmd</code></p>

<p>We’ll keep our R and Markdown scripts separate at first, but know that
you’ll submit an RMarkdown file for your final project.</p>

<h2 id="markdown-syntax">Markdown syntax</h2>

<p>Rather than list Markdown syntax here, I’ll direct you to an excellent
resource: <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org"><em>The Markdown Guide</em></a>. On
this site, you find example of both <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">basic syntax (headers, italics,
bold, links)</a> and <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/">more
advanced syntax (tables and
footnotes)</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">Markdown Guide basic syntax page for
making headers</a>:</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/markdown_guide_example.png" alt="Markdown Guide" /></p>

<p>On the left you have the Markdown syntax. To make a header, just put a
pound sign / hash (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>) in front of the line. As you want smaller
headers, just keep adding pound signs. The middle column shows you the
underlying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML (web markup
language)</a> code. This isn’t that
important for us. The last column, however, shows the text as it will
render in your final document.</p>

<p>The site is also nice in that it shows you a few different ways, when
they exist, of doing the same thing. Take some time to go through the
site — it won’t take long — and keep it in mind as a reference for
the future.</p>
